# SYSLIB Common Font Minification Tool. - webfont gen
client version

Build 2014030201.

This is a tool to compress font and gen webfont.
It can trim font with a map 
and then  
convert TTF/OTF/SVG/WOFF/EOT.... to TTF/SVG/WOFF/EOT and gen webfont css,then pack with zip.

Now only windows are supported.
I'm working on the dependencies' compile script.

just head to test dir and have fun.
